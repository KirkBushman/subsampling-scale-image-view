Subsampling Scale Image View
===========================

An up to date version of SubsamplingScaleImageView using Java 8, all work from davemorrissey [here](https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view)
A custom image view for Android, designed for photo galleries and displaying huge images (e.g. maps and building plans) without `OutOfMemoryError`s.
Includes pinch to zoom, panning, rotation and animation support, and allows easy extension so you can add your own overlays and touch event detection.

#### Image display

* Display images from assets, resources, the file system or bitmaps
* Automatically rotate images from the file system (e.g. the camera or gallery) according to EXIF
* Manually rotate images in 90Â° increments
* Display a region of the source image
* Use a preview image while large images load
* Swap images at runtime
* Use a custom bitmap decoder

*With tiling enabled:*

* Display huge images, larger than can be loaded into memory
* Show high resolution detail on zooming in
* Tested up to 20,000x20,000px, though larger images are slower

#### Gesture detection

* One finger pan
* Two finger pinch to zoom
* Quick scale (one finger zoom)
* Pan while zooming
* Seamless switch between pan and zoom
* Fling momentum after panning
* Double tap to zoom in and out
* Options to disable pan and/or zoom gestures

#### Animation

* Public methods for animating the scale and center
* Customisable duration and easing
* Optional uninterruptible animations

#### Overridable event detection
* Supports `OnClickListener` and `OnLongClickListener`
* Supports interception of events using `GestureDetector` and `OnTouchListener`
* Extend to add your own gestures

#### Easy integration
* Use within a `ViewPager` to create a photo gallery
* Easily restore scale, center and orientation after screen rotation
* Can be extended to add overlay graphics that move and scale with the image
* Handles view resizing and `wrap_content` layout

## Quick start

**1)** Add this library as a dependency in your app's build.gradle file.

    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.davemorrissey.labs:subsampling-scale-image-view:3.10.0'
    }

**2)** Add the view to your layout XML.

    <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" >

        <com.davemorrissey.labs.subscaleview.SubsamplingScaleImageView
            android:id="@+id/imageView"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"/>

    </LinearLayout>

**3a)** Now, in your fragment or activity, set the image resource, asset name or file path.

    SubsamplingScaleImageView imageView = (SubsamplingScaleImageView)findViewById(id.imageView);
    imageView.setImage(ImageSource.resource(R.drawable.monkey));
    // ... or ...
    imageView.setImage(ImageSource.asset("map.png"))
    // ... or ...
    imageView.setImage(ImageSource.uri("/sdcard/DCIM/DSCM00123.JPG"));

**3b)** Or, if you have a `Bitmap` object in memory, load it into the view. This is unsuitable for large images because it bypasses subsampling - you may get an `OutOfMemoryError`.

    SubsamplingScaleImageView imageView = (SubsamplingScaleImageView)findViewById(id.imageView);
    imageView.setImage(ImageSource.bitmap(bitmap));
